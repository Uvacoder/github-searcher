üîùFeedback: 
This project was quite interesting to carry out, the truth is that beyond the result it is always good to practice and take on challenges. Although the truth is this week has been very busy with the completion of the master's degree, I am happy with the result and the work done from the beginning to the end. Gonna keep also with the project to improve.
